# Changelog

All notable changes to PySuricata are documented here.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **CSS integrity test suite** — `test_css_integrity.py` with 9 automated checks (file presence, selector coverage, `!important` budget, breakpoint standardization, inline handler removal)
- **Pre-commit hooks** — `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml/toml, ruff lint+format, and fast pytest
- **Colored header icons** — Sun/moon toggle, calendar, clock, download, and pin SVG icons now use theme-appropriate colors instead of monochrome

### Changed
- **CSS modularization** — Replaced monolithic `style.css` (8,742 lines) with 14 scoped partials (`_00-tokens.css` through `_13-utilities.css`), loaded via `load_css_dir()` with caching
- **Inline event handler removal** — Replaced all inline `onclick`/`onchange` handlers with `data-action` attributes and delegated event listeners
- **Ruff lint cleanup** — Auto-fixed 656 issues, reformatted 36 files, manually fixed F821/E711/B007/F401 across 7 source files
- **Report size reduction** — HTML output is ~15% smaller (1.17MB vs 1.38MB for Titanic dataset)

### Performance
- **No regression** — Report generation is ~15% faster (0.045s vs 0.053s avg on Titanic dataset, 891 rows × 12 cols)

### Removed
- `style.css` (monolithic), `style.css.backup`, `style_updated.css`, `chart.min.js`, `functionality.js.backup`, `cards_new.py`

## [0.0.16] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Polars nested type support** — Structs and Lists are now gracefully handled as categorical variables (with debug warnings) instead of causing inference errors

### Changed
- **Performance optimization** — optimized `_safe_compute` to use NumPy arrays for type checks, reducing overhead in large datasets

## [0.0.15] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Python 3.14 CI testing** — Added Python 3.14 to CI test matrix
- **Changelog CI check** — PRs now require a changelog entry
- **Mermaid architecture diagrams** — Replaced ASCII art with 5 interactive diagrams

### Fixed
- **MathJax formula rendering** — Fixed `ignoreHtmlClass` regex that prevented all formula rendering
- **Code/equation styling** — Changed code and math colors from green to standard gray
- **Memory stress test** — Bumped threshold from 200→250 MB for Python 3.14 compatibility

### Changed
- **Dropped Python 3.9** — Minimum version is now Python 3.10
- **CI runs on PR only** — Tests no longer run on push to main (CD handles releases)
- **Cleaned dev dependencies** — Removed `ydata-profiling` and `ipykernel` (not 3.14-compatible)
- **Cleaned examples/** — Removed benchmark scripts, generated reports, and ydata comparisons
- **Removed `.claude/skills`** — Cleaned up unused skill symlinks
- **Documentation improvements** — Rewrote API reference, complexity analysis, quality flags (tables), stats overview

### Removed
- **`report_preview.png`** — Replaced with link to live interactive report on GitHub Pages
- Stale dates from stats documentation pages

## [0.0.14] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Polars LazyFrame support** — LazyFrames are now automatically collected before profiling
- **ReportConfig alias** — Added `ReportConfig` as an alias for `ProfileConfig` for better API discoverability

### Fixed

## [0.0.13] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **CLI tool** — New command-line interface with `pysuricata profile` and `pysuricata summarize` commands
- **Comprehensive stress tests** — New `test_complexity_analysis.py` with time/space profiling
- **Python 3.14 support** — Officially supported in package metadata

### Fixed
- **Memory leak fixes** — Resolved memory leaks in KMV sketch, ExtremeTracker, and chunk metadata

### Changed
- **Realistic benchmarks** — Updated README and docs with measured performance figures

## [0.0.11] - 2025-12-XX

### Added
- Enhanced documentation with mathematical formulas
- Comprehensive examples gallery
- Detailed algorithm documentation (Welford, Pébay, KMV, Misra-Gries)
